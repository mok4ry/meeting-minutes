###UPKEEP:
Target should have the filter for the vacuum, he will get the pcard and buy it. Cleaning sessions every weekend. We can put up the sse awards ourselves.

###PR: 
Kristen: I know nothing about the PR committee. She is pretty sure she has never seen them. Is there anything we can do to make the PR committee in the sse. She feels like the sse and the PR committee are two separate things. How can we make PR agents feel like part of the SSE. Brad talked about it, the PR committee feels like more for SE than SSE. 
Dom: Greg and Brain go to the SSE lab, but the rest are freshman. We need to help people feel more welcome.
Nsa wants to meet march 2 at 7pm. Someone needs to hold the lab for it. We need to watch for random government haters that might want to disrupt their talk. WE WILL KICK THEM OUT.
An alumnus from valve wants to give a talk. We might work with wic for this.
When should we tell companies the best time for being in the lab. Brad says we should do a trash thirty headcount to figure that out. It would be useful to know how many people and how many mentees are coming in to the lab.  A lot of the other mentoring labs do that. Rob thinks it’d be cool to have stats on it. PROCESS ANALYIS. Turnstyle to count people in/out out the lab!! Put projects on the website.
Ways to bring people in the sse lab. They dont think its welcoming. When people go to the sse. Kristen proposes sse friend on duty. Mentor on duty can introduce people. We could put up flyers for events to try to get. We should do the heist and maybe an opt-in freshman connection. Make sure that that mentor on duty connects with people.

###FUNDRASING
Tried contacting marissa and she has not be easy to contact. Metcalf is going to keep bugging her. Padfilios got dropped. Metcalf will look at getting them tomorrow.

###TALKS:
Micotalks went well.
Prof M says he will come in and do a resume workshop next week. Dylan will try to push him into the talks slot. No talk career fair week.

###EVENTS:
12 people interested in ski trip. Using the family plan for that hopefully. Waivers need to be signed for people to go on the trip.
SSE Hockey. Talk about better group rates with the polissium. Ask them how that works. Emailed hairris about boxes during the first week in March. WE ARE GETTING BOXES GUYS.

###TECH: 
Anyone have problems? No cool.

###MENTORING:
Head count, an idea that was brought up earlier this week. We should keep a running count of how many people are coming in specifically. The department is hoping to have someone as a new chair by the end of spring. So we might want a headcount so that the department knows what up Signb a sheet and count people.
Mock interviews: 6 interviewers signed up, harris is sending someone, so about 8 interviewers. Approx. 16 interviewees. So he’s going to lock down the schedule and start planning and meeting with interviewees.
CS1 and CS2 review sessions happening soon.

###PROJECTS:
Lots of orders for projects
Tortuga – got some parts! Waiting on others. 
Corban wants to have a ‘that was easy’ button to increase the pr meter.

###TREASURE:
$1228 is what we are worth. Send in your receipts to treasurer. Have budgets to Treasurer by the 27 th for March.  Write what the receipt is for. Public finances: Vallino says we should do donation records. We should have a record of the money that we have. Auditable records. Chelsea says we should consider be an SG club. We should ask alum for money. We don’t want to be an SG club.  Budgeting is weird if you’re an sg club. You’re put in money tiers and there are constraints on events. You need to register events. Even stuff like fundraising runs. It’s a lot of bureaucracy. It’s generally disregarded. We need to seriously revise the fundraising head position.

###VP: 
IDEA, realtalk. Can we paint the walls in the room? We want to do a mural. POWER in the display case? Because then we could put the LED marquee there. The podium should be moved away. We should figure out where to move it. No one can agree on where it should be.

###OTHER:  
Register for the illustration of innovation thing.
