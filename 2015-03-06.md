Sardines is on the 16 th. This Monday we are going bowling. We will make flyers for some events. Wic rented out ritter and invited us for skating. Promote all the events!

###Mentoring: 
The review sessions went well. More people showed up than planned. A lot of people signed up after numbers were pulled. Mock interviews went well, but less interviews showed up than who signed up. We should just watch the numbers, we dont want any cut offs. A lot more people showed up than signed up. Liked 50% more people showed up than signed up. Sign ups are sent to professors to email to classes. We should have professors push sign ups. We should try to forward the cs2 review session information to se professors.  With the mock interviews, the fewer people who showed up, but got more interviews

###Tech:
Projects: Posters are pretty! Morgan will try to publicize the template. He is going to try to export the template to word so people can easily use it. Tortugas initial prototype should be done this weekend. Oculus is looking toward getting a vm to host. SSE card game is still looking for card suggestions. OpenBCI is looking for more people. Shooting Gallery Game, two people joined last night. Game engine progress.

Pizza is expensive. Really expensive. We need to make about $3000 in a year to maintain a balance.  We need to contact companies and alum for money.
